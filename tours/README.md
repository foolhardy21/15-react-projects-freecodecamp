## Overview

The boilerplate code is provided consisting of CSS styling and the functionality is added on top of that using React.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Remove the items from the list of Tours
- Switch between the complete and partial info of the Tour using a button


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Conditional Rendering

### What I learned

I learnt how the JSON data is requested from a url using async/await function. I learnt how the content to be rendered is changed using a state variable depending on the condition. I learnt how the state and data is passed between components as props.
